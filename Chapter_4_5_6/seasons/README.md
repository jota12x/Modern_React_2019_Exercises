This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The project was to create an applicationt which shows the current hemisphere of the user and show if its chilly or sunny based on the hemisphere and months.

### Conditions:

  If the user is in the northern hemisphere and between October and March - print "Burr, it's chilly"
  
  If the user is in the northern hemisphere and between March and October - print "Let's hit the beach"
  
  If the user is in the southern hemisphere and between October and March - print "Let's hit the beach"
  
  If the user is in the southern hemisphere and between March and October - print "Burr, it's chilly"
